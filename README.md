# Know HTTP Status Code

A visual guide explaining HTTP protocol, status code and etc...

## About

The intuition of this document is to explain a little about HTTP status code (not so hard) in a way that people can understand easily the concepts.

## How

A document like poster with friendly UI and examples that get straight to the point in concepts.

## Why

The idea started when I saw this [link](http://www.steveschoger.com/status-code-poster/) and thought: Why not a HTML of this with a nice view and easily to understand? The intuition is to help people who not know's the basics about HTTP.

> All the code could be done only with HTML, CSS and JS but behind the all ideia I wanted test [Rollup.js](rollupjs.org) bundler with [React](reactjs.org).
